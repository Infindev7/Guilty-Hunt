While he did attend part of the conference, he likely made a brief return trip, relying on the late hour and his familiarity with the property to avoid detection. The flaw in his alibi lies in the *late-night snack receipt*. While it proves he was at the hotel *at 11:47 PM*, it doesn't account for the time *before* that. A quick round trip was possible, and the snack receipt was a planned piece of evidence to solidify his presence later in the evening."

Anya likely used her knowledge of the backstage layout and the brief period of darkness during a scene change at the very start of the intermission to quickly and silently move Maestro Thorne (perhaps having incapacitated him beforehand) out of his dressing room via a less obvious route – possibly a connecting passage or a rarely used service door she knew about. She then rushed to her own dressing room to establish her alibi by being seen by other orchestra members during the *later* part of the intermission. The stage manager's check occurred towards the *end* of the intermission, by which time Thorne was already gone, and Anya was in her room. The 'heated phone call' was likely part of her plan or a result of the stress of the situation. The cut solo provided a superficial motive for the investigators to focus on, while her actual method was more subtle and relied on exploiting the brief window of opportunity and the layout of the theater. The witnesses saw her, but not for the *entire* intermission, leaving a crucial gap in the early minutes."

While the *latest version* wasn't there, a closer examination of the cloud storage logs would reveal an *earlier draft* with significant portions of the 'missing' content, indicating Alistair likely saved it at some point and then forgot.

    "truth": "Clara Hayes did poison Alistair Finch. The flaw lies in her explanation of the *substance she added* and the *employee's testimony*. While the employee saw her add a liquid and heard her call it 'hops extract,' a closer look at the security footage, specifically the moment of transfer, would reveal Ms. Hayes subtly *swapping* the labeled vial of hops extract with an identical-looking vial containing the poison. She likely prepared this switch beforehand, knowing Mr. Finch would be the first to taste the experimental batch. The employee's testimony is truthful to what they *heard*, but doesn't account for the surreptitious switch. Ms. Hayes used her knowledge of the brewing process and the trust of her colleagues to execute the poisoning. Her 'fiction writing' and 'shock' explanations are convenient lies to deflect suspicion."

While it shows a green light as his car enters the intersection, a careful frame-by-frame analysis (which wasn't initially done) would reveal a *flicker* or a very brief yellow light just before turning green. Mr. Harrison, eager to proceed, might have accelerated as soon as he saw green without noticing the preceding yellow, especially if he was slightly speeding. His passenger's confirmation is likely based on the same initial perception. The greater damage to Mr. Harrison's car supports the idea that he was traveling at a higher speed. Ms. Davies's braking and the concentrated front-end damage on her car are consistent with her attempt to stop. The reported light malfunction, though days prior, adds a layer of doubt to the reliability of the light sequence at that intersection."
